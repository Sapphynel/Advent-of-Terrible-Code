# Advent of (Terrible) Code

Once upon a time, some people shoehorned me into something called Advent of Code.
It was actually pretty fun, now that I think about it, but I've coded a lot less
over the past few months/years. Thus, this is meant as a little journal(?)
thing to make sure, uh, I don't forget how to code. Even though I've probably
forgotten a lot.

## How it's structured

Pretty simple; Advent of Code gives you problems to do, one every day. I haven't
actually done them all, but that should be enough to orient you.

Problems are done in Python, because my brain is too smol to actually do them
with other better languages (tm).

## Why not LeetCode or CodeForces or something else?

Honestly? Because this was a lot more fun.

Have some fun or something. IDK.
